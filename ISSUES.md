# Issues

*This document is for managing feature requests, bugs, and ideas raised in external
discussion (as opposed to the internal items logged in `TODO.md`).  The volume and needs
should make it easy enough to handle this manually here rather than using a more involved
issue tracker of some sort.*

*Issue numbers are monotonically increasing regardless of issue type, and do not change.
Priorities do not need to be explicitly specified—we can just comment informally on that,
or possibly just reorder items below based on rough priority (while making sure to track
high number for new issue entry).*

## Bugs

**\#1** - Seeding and round robin bracket charts should have space for showing (and/or
entering) scores after each player or team in the matchup [Struble]

**\#2** - Division assignment for round robin stage should be done in a snake pattern
based on team rank (1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2,...), rather than alternating (1, 2, 1, 2,...)
[Struble]

**\#3** - Non-champion three-headed monster should always be seeded last in the round
robin stage (rather than ranked by average player rank) [Struble]

**\#4** - Seeding and round robin final rankings should be based on: win pct, then *points
pct* (rather than points diff) [Struble]
- After that, ties should then be broken by head-to-head and common-opponent records,
  followed by *[TBD] (points for(?), ...)*

## Feature/Enhancement Requests

**\#5** - Mobile app for entering game scores [Struble]
- Players should be able to see just their own games, and enter scores for games as they
  are completed
- Other players for a game should be notified, and given the ability to confirm, correct,
  or dispute a score.
- Maybe allow players see their own stats as well
