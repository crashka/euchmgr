# Euchre Manager

The purpose of this application is to help facilitate and/or manage a Beta Upsilon-style
euchre tournament (for anyone who knows what that means).  The basic design mimics the
processes and tracking mechanisms developed over the past twenty-whatever years.  The
introduction of digitization and automation is intended to provide support for the
tournament operators and rules committee, and not to replace them.

There are three user interface components to the application:

- The **Admin UI**, which can be used as the system of record for all scores, stats, and
  standings
- The **Mobile UI**, which can be used as the data entry point for player registration,
  partner picks, and game scores
- The **Charts and Dashboards** layer, which can provide projectable representations of
  the traditionally hand-drawn brackets and scoring posters
  
Behind the scenes is a database and some application server code to help implement the
process flow and ensure the integrity of the data for the tournament.
